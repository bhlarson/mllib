Comparing these plot, I evalute the potential improvement of a specific type of model.  For example, if the IoU continue to improve with training, I'll continue to train the model.  If the per-class IoU converges with additonal training, it may not be neccessary to manipulate the class balance.  Does one model convergence more quickly or to a higher value than another?"
